# Google Code Jam 2020 - Qualification round - 2020-04-04

Here is my submission for the 2020 qualification round where I solved 3
problems to reach the 30 points required to go through to the next round.

I had not participated in Google Code Jam since 2016 and they have since changed
the submission method. While you previously had to download test datasets, run
them locally through your solution and upload the output to the platform, you
now upload your code and Google executes it feeding it STDIN. The other thing
is that [the Code Jam platform runs Python 3.5](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/faq#platform)
so you can't use features from more recent versions.

The problems I solved were:

 1. [Vestigium](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/000000000019fd27/000000000020993c)
 1. [Nesting Depth](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/000000000019fd27/0000000000209a9f)
 1. [Parenting Partnering Returns](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/000000000019fd27/000000000020bdf9)
 
 
 The first commit in this folder contains the solution as I submitted them. I have
 refactored and reworked them a bit afterwards notably to include the sample inputs
 as unit tests.
